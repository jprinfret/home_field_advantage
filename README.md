# Evaluating Home Field Advantage in the NFL, NHL, MLB, and NBA

## The data
[Sports Data iO](https://sportsdata.io/) offers a free-trial to their sports data api, which allowed us to pull regular season data for NFL, NHL, and MLB. 

[Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/) offers a free-trial to their sports api, which allowed us to pull regular season data for the NBA.

We then calculcated a home point differential (home team score minus away team score), which was the focus of our project.

## Questions asked:
1. Is there home field advantage in any of the four major sports? 

2. Is there an advantage to playing at home earlier in the season as compared to later in the season?

3.

## The Results:
1. Our t-tests indicate that for 3 of the 4 major professional sports (Football, Hockey, and Basketball), the average home team point differential is significantly greater than 0, and thus there is statistical evidence to suggest "home field advantage" exists in these sports. However, there exists no statistical evidence to suggest that the average home team point differential is significantly greater than 0 in baseball (this suggests we cannot definitively say that "home field advantage" exists in baseball).

2. Despite probability suggesting that a team is more likely to win at home earlier in the season, there exists no statistical evidence to support this theory.

3. Our limited sample size indicates that the home team, on average, covers the spread more than the away team, when the home team is an east coast team and the away team is a west coast team.

## Future Applications and Importance
Being able to quantify/analyze the concept of "home field advantage" is something that sports staticians have debated for a few years now. There are serious limitations to the data used (e.g., is the 2018 regular season truly a random sample of the population?), however the results are conclusive/meaningful. 

As sports beating moves closer and closer to being legal, this information can be valuable to gamblers (until it is widely recognized and priced out, if not already).
