## Future Applications and Importance
Being able to quantify/analyze the concept of "home field advantage" is something that sports staticians have debated for a few years now. There are serious limitations to the data used (e.g., is the 2018 regular season truly a random sample of the population?), however the results are conclusive/meaningful. 

As sports beating moves closer and closer to being legal, this information can be valuable to gamblers (until it is widely recognized and priced out, if not already).
